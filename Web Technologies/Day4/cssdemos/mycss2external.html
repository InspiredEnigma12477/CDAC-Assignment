                <p>With Python, Efteling started the implementation of a new strategy: development from a fairy-tale forest into an all-round amusement park. This change led to many problems with the local community. Environmentalists tried to get the building permit withdrawn, and the park's neighbors feared problems arising from growing visitor numbers. Because of the likely noise pollution, the highest court of public justice ordered the construction to be stopped. After some time, construction recommenced, but legal problems continued for several more years.

                    In 1995, when operating hours were extended until 10Â pm, the coaster's 45-decibel noise level became a problem once more. Plans were submitted to the local municipality, describing an extension and complete renovation of the coaster, which would reduce the noise substantially. Due to the high cost, the funds were allocated to the construction of a new enclosed (to reduce noise problems for the park's surroundings) roller coaster, 'Vogel Rok'.
                    
                    Efteling hoped to get a night license for Python with some small renovations (new trains and a chain lift), but only with a change in the permit could Python remain open until 10 pm.
                    
                    In 2005 the trains were replaced by Kumbak Coasters designed by Karel Willemen and in December 2011 with Vekoma MK1212 trains. </p>
