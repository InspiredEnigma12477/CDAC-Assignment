Spring boot internals explained : 
Important components of a Spring Boot Application

Below is the starting point of a Spring Boot Application

@SpringBootApplication
public class HelloSpringBootApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(HelloSpringBootApplication.class, args);
	}

}
About : org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication
It's Class  used to bootstrap and launch a Spring application from a Java main method. 

By default class will perform the following steps to bootstrap the application
1. Create an ApplicationContext instance (representing SC)
2. Manages life cycle of spring beans
3. Launches embedded Tomcat container


@SpringBootApplication - This is where all the spring boot magic happens.
It consists of following 3 annotations.

1. @SpringBootConfiguration
It  tells spring boot  that this class here can have several bean definitions. We can define various spring beans here and those beans will be available at run time .

2. @EnableAutoConfiguration
It tells spring boot to automatically configure the spring application based on the dependencies that it sees on the classpath.

eg:
If we have a MySql dependency in our pom.xml , Spring Boot will automatically create a data source,using the properties in application.properties file.  

If we have spring web in pom.xml , then spring boot will automatically create the dispatcher servlet n other beans (HandlerMapping , ViewResolver)

All the xml, all the java based configuration is now gone.It all comes for free thanks to spring boot to enable auto configuration annotation. 

3. @ComponentScan (equivalent to xml tag : context:component-scan)

So this  tells us that spring boot to  scan through the classes and see which all classes are marked with the stereotype annotations like @Component Or @Service @Repository and manage  these spring beans . Default base-pkg is the pkg in which main class is defined.
Can be overridden by
eg : 
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com")
For scanning entities :  (equivalent to packagesToScan)
@EntityScan(basePackages = "com.app.pojos")
