Maven Overview
Enter Spring
Why Spring 
What is it ?
Dependency Injection / IoC
Spring Bean life cycle
Bean Wiring

Why Spring ?
Simplifies overall java development

What is it ?
container --manages life cycle of spring beans
(spring bean --- java obj whose life cycle completely managed by SC(spring container)
eg : rest controller, controller, service,DAO.
framework --rdy made implementation of std patterns(eg :MVC,Proxy,singleton,factory, ORM ...)


Spring is modular n extensive framework.


Why Spring : loosely coupled application
Via : D.I / AOP


What is dependency injection ?


In JSP---JB---DAO(Utils) -- POJO --DB layers
Dependent Objs -- JavaBean , Hibernate based DAO, JDBC Based DAO
Dependencies --- DAO,HibUtils(SessionFactory) , DBUtils(DB connection)

All of above are examples of tight coupling.


Why --Any time the nature of the dependency changes , dependent obj is affected(i.e u will have to make changes in dependent obj)
eg : When the dependency of Java Bean changes from JDBC Based DAO to Hibernate based DAO , in case of user authentication , javabean class has to be modified to handle invalid login case(i.e handle NoResultException)


Tight coupling --strongly un desirable.
Why -- difficult to maintain or extend.

In above examples , Java bean creates the instance of DAO.
Hibernate based DAO , gets SF from HibUtils.
JDBC based DAO ,gets db connection from DBUtils.

i.e dependent objects are managing their dependencies. ---traditional/conventional programming model.


What is D.I ?(Dependency injection=wiring=collaboration between dependent & dependency)
Instead of dependent objs managing their dependencies , 3rd party containers(eg : Angular / Spring/ EJB/ WC) will auto create the dependecies & make it available to dependents, directly @ run time.

Since dependent are no longer managing dependencies --its called as IoC ---Inversion of control

Hollywood principle --You don't call us , we will call you....
SC --- > Dependent objs (i.e SC will create the dependencies for the dependent objs)

eg : UserController
@Autowired
private IUserService service;

In DAO layer
@AutoWired
private SessionFactory sf;


Pre requisite : Already added STS plug-in / STS 3.9.18
Steps for spring nature to Java project

Important :  Extract spring api-docs
Objective : Create Spring based Java SE  project

1. Create Maven based Java SE project with spring dependencies
2. Create dependent n dependency classes 
4. Refer : <resources> & create spring bean config xml file.(Using STS support)
5. Add namespace <beans>


More details about <bean> tag 
Attributes
1. id --mandatory --bean unique id
2. class --- mandatory -- Fully qualified bean class name
3. scope --- In Java SE --- singleton | prototype
In web app singleton | prototype | request | session | global session
Default scope = singleton
singleton --- SC will share single bean instance for multiple requests/demands(via ctx.getBean)
prototype -- SC creates NEW bean instance per  request/demand.

4. lazy-init --- boolean attribute. default value=false.
Applicable only to singleton beans.
SC will auto create singleton spring bean instance --- @ SC start up.

5. init-method --name of init style method(public void anyName() throws Exception{..})
called by SC after setter based D.I

6. destroy-method --name of destroy style method
(public void anyName() throws Exception{..})
called by SC before GC of spring bean (applicable only to singleton beans)


API 
How to get ready to use spring beans from SC ?
API of BeanFactory
public <T> T getBean(String beanId,Class<T> beanClass) throws BeansException
