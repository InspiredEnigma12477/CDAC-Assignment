SOAP vs REST web services


SOAP stands for simple object access protocol
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

Protocol vs Architectural style
 SOAP is a standard protocol to create web services
Rest is architectural style to create web services.

Contract
Client and Server are bound with WSDL contract in SOAP
There is no contract between client and Server in REST

Format Support
SOAP supports only XML format
REST web services supports XML, json and plain text etc.

Maintainability
SOAP web services are hard to maintain as if we do any changes in WSDL , we need to create client stub again
REST web services are generally easy to maintain.

Service interfaces vs URI
SOAP uses Service interfaces to expose business logic
Rest uses URI to expose business logic

Security
SOAP has its own security : WS-security
Rest inherits its security from underlying transport layer.

Bandwidth
SOAP requires more bandwidth and resources as it uses XML messages to exchange information
REST requires less bandwith and resources. It can use JSON also.

Learning curve
SOAP web services are hard to learn as you need to understand WSDL , client stub.
REST web services are easy to understand as you need to annotate plain java class with JAX-RS annotations to use various HTTP methods .
