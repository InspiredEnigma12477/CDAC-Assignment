Hibernate's   Automatic Dirty checking

The process of automatically updating the database with the changes to the persistent object when the session is flushed(@ commit)  is known as automatic dirty checking.
 
An object(POJO) enters persistent state when any one of the following happens:

When the code invokes session.save, session.persist or session.saveorUpdate or session.merge
OR
When the code invokes session.load or session.get
OR
Result of JPQL

Any changes to a persistent object are automatically saved to the database when the session in flushed. 

Flushing is the process of synchronizing the underlying database with the objects in the session's L1 cache.

Even though there is a session.flush method available but you generally donâ€™t need to invoke it explicitly. 

A session gets flushed when the transaction is commited.
