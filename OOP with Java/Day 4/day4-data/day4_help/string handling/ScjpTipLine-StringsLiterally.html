<hr width="80%" align="center">
This month, I'm going to tackle String literals and how they're handled in Java. If you read <a href="http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200408/Journal200408.jsp#a1" target="_blank">last month's SCJP Tip Line article</a>,
you'll find that this article is a nice follow up all about Strings. If
you didn't read it, no big deal - I plan to cover enough information
here to get you up to speed. String literals are a little "special" in
Java in the way that they are treated. For the most part, the
information contained in this post <i>is not</i> on the SCJP exam, but I see it on mock exams all the time and it comes up in the <a href="http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&amp;f=24" target="_blank">SCJP Forum</a> quite often. Besides, it's just darned interesting stuff.<br>
<br>
Let's start off by asking a simple question. <i>What is a String Literal?</i>
A String literal is a sequence of characters between quotation marks,
such as "string" or "literal". You've probably used String literals
hundreds of times in your own applications. You might not, however,
have realized just how special String literals are in Java.
<h3>Strings are Immutable</h3>
<i>So what makes String literals so special?</i> Well, first of all,
it's very important to remember that String objects are immutable. That
means that, once created, a String object cannot be changed (short of
using something like reflection to get at private data). Immutable, you
say? Unchangable? What about this code?<br>
<br>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td bgcolor="#e4d2b8">
            <font size="-1"><b>Source Code</b></font>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#f0e6d5">
            <pre>            
public class ImmutableStrings
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String start = "Hello";
        String end = start.concat(" World!");
        System.out.println(end);
    }
}

// Output

Hello World!
            </pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
Well look at that, the String changed...or did it? In that code, no
String object was ever changed. We start by assigning "Hello" to our
variable, <font face="courier">start</font>. That causes a new String object to be created on the heap and a reference to that object is stored in <font face="courier">start</font>. Next, we invoke the method <font face="courier">concat(String)</font> on that object. Well, here's the trick, if we look at the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" target="_blank">API Spec for String</a>, you'll see this in the description of the <font face="courier">concat(String)</font> method:<br>
<font face="arial">
<blockquote>
Concatenates the specified string to the end of this string. <br>
If the length of the argument string is 0, then this String object is returned. <b>Otherwise, a new String object is created,</b>
representing a character sequence that is the concatenation of the
character sequence represented by this String object and the character
sequence represented by the argument string.
<br><br>
Examples: 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"cares".concat("s") returns "caress"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to".concat("get").concat("her") returns "together"
 <br><br>
Parameters:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;str - the String that is concatenated to the end of this String. <br>
Returns:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a
string that represents the concatenation of this object's characters
followed by the string argument's characters.
</blockquote>
</font>Notice the part I've highlighted in bold. When you concatenate
one String to another, it doesn't actually change the String object, it
simply creates a new one that contains the contents of both of the
original Strings, one after the other. That's exactly what we did
above. The String object referenced by the local variable <font face="courier">start</font> never changed. In fact, if you added the statement <font face="courier">System.out.println(start);</font> after you invoked the concat method, you would see that <font face="courier">start</font>
still referenced a String object that contained just "Hello". And just
in case you were wondering, the '+' operator does the exact same thing
as the concat() method.<br>
<br>
Strings really are immutable.
<h3>Storage of Strings - The String Literal Pool</h3>
If you've done any preparation for the SCJP exam (and quite possibly
even if you haven't), you've probably heard of the "String Literal
Pool." <i>What is the String Literal Pool?</i>
Most often, I hear people say that it is a collection of String
objects. Although that's close, it's not exactly correct. Really, it's
a collection of <i>references</i> to String objects. Strings, even
though they are immutable, are still objects like any other in Java.
Objects are created on the heap and Strings are no exception. So,
Strings that are part of the "String Literal Pool" still live on the
heap, but they have references to them from the String Literal Pool.<br>
<br>
Yeah, so that doesn't really explain what the pool is, or what it's
for, does it? Well, because String objects are immutable, it's safe for
multiple references to "share" the same String object. Take a look at
this example:<br>
<br>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td bgcolor="#e4d2b8">
            <font size="-1"><b>Source Code</b></font>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#f0e6d5">
            <pre>            
public class ImmutableStrings
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String one = "someString";
        String two = "someString";
        
        System.out.println(one.equals(two));
        System.out.println(one == two);
    }
}

// Output

true
true
            </pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
In such a case, there is really no need to make two instances of an
identical String object. If a String object could be changed, as a
StringBuffer can be changed, we would be forced to create two separate
objects. But, as we know that String objects cannot change, we can
safely share a String object among the two String references, <font face="courier">one</font> and <font face="courier">two</font>. This is done through the String literal pool. Here's how it is accomplished:<br>
<br>
When a .java file is compiled into a .class file, any String literals
are noted in a special way, just as all constants are. When a class is <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/execution.doc.html#44459" target="_blank">loaded</a>
(note that loading happens prior to initialization), the JVM goes
through the code for the class and looks for String literals. When it
finds one, it checks to see if an equivalent String is already
referenced from the heap. If not, it creates a String instance on the
heap and stores a reference to that object in the constant table. Once
a reference is made to that String object, any references to that
String literal throughout your program are simply replaced with the
reference to the object referenced from the String Literal Pool.<br>
<br>
So, in the example shown above, there would be only one entry in the
String Literal Pool, which would refer to a String object that
contained the word "someString". Both of the local variables, <font face="courier">one</font> and <font face="courier">two</font>,
would be assigned a reference to that single String object. You can see
that this is true by looking at the output of the above program. While
the equals() method checks to see if the String objects contain the
same data ("someString"), the <font face="courier">==</font> operator,
when used on objects, checks for referential equality - that means that
it will return true if and only if the two reference variables refer to
the <i>exact same object</i>. In such a case, the references are equal. From the above output, you can see that the local variables, <font face="courier">one</font> and <font face="courier">two</font>, not only refer to Strings that contain the same data, they refer to the same object.<br>
<br>
Graphically, our objects and references would look something like this:<br>
<br>
<center><img src="ScjpTipLine-StringsLiterally_files/stringLiterals1.jpg" border="1"></center>
<br>
Note, however, that this is a special behavior for <i>String Literals</i>. Constructing Strings using the "new" keyword implies a different sort of behavior. Let's look at an example:<br>
<br>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td bgcolor="#e4d2b8">
            <font size="-1"><b>Source Code</b></font>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#f0e6d5">
            <pre>            
public class ImmutableStrings
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String one = "someString";
        String two = new String("someString");
        
        System.out.println(one.equals(two));
        System.out.println(one == two);
    }
}

// Output

true
false
            </pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
In this case, we actually end up with a slightly different behavior
because of the keyword "new." In such a case, references to the two
String literals are still put into the constant table (the String
Literal Pool), but, when you come to the keyword "new," the JVM is
obliged to create a new String object at run-time, rather than using
the one from the constant table.<br>
<br>
In such a case, although the two String references refer to String objects that contain the same data, "someString", they <i>do not</i> refer to the same object. That can be seen from the output of the program. While the equals() method returns true, the <font face="courier">==</font>
operator, which checks for referential equality, returns false,
indicating that the two variables refer to distinct String objects.<br>
<br>
Once again, if you'd like to see this graphically, it would look
something like this. Note that the String object referenced from the
String Literal Pool is created when the class is loaded while the other
String object is created at runtime, when the "new String..." line is
executed.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="ScjpTipLine-StringsLiterally_files/stringLiterals2.jpg" border="1"></center>
<br>
If you'd like to get both of these local variables to refer to the same object, you can use the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#intern%28%29" target="_blank">intern()</a> method defined in String. Invoking <font face="courier">two.intern()</font>
will look for a String object referenced from the String Literal Pool
that has the same value as the one you invoked the intern method upon.
If one is found, a reference to that String is returned and can be
assigned to your local variable. If you did so, you'd have a picture
that looks just like the one above, with both local variables, <font face="courier">one</font> and <font face="courier">two</font>,
referring to the same String object, which is also referenced from the
String Literal Pool. At that point, the second String object, which was
created at run-time, would be eligible for garbage collection.<br>
<h3>Garbage Collection</h3>
<i>What makes an object eligible for garbage collection?</i> If you're
preparing for the SCJP exam (or even if you're not), the answer to that
question should roll right off your tongue. An object is eligible for
garbage collection when it is no longer referenced from an active part
of the application. <i>Anyone see what is special about garbage collection for String literals?</i> Let's look at an example and see if you can see where this is going.<br>
<br>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td bgcolor="#e4d2b8">
            <font size="-1"><b>Source Code</b></font>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#f0e6d5">
            <pre>            
public class ImmutableStrings
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String one = "someString";
        String two = new String("someString");
        
        one = two = null;
    }
}
            </pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
<i>Just before the main method ends, how many objects are available for garbage collection? 0? 1? 2?</i> <br>
<br>
The answer is 1. Unlike most objects, String literals always have a
reference to them from the String Literal Pool. That means that they <i>always</i>
have a reference to them and are, therefore, not eligible for garbage
collection. This is the same example as I used above so you can see
what our picture looked liked originally there. Once we assign our
variables, <font face="courier">one</font> and <font face="courier">two</font>, to null, we end up with a picture that looks like this:<br>
<br>
<center><img src="ScjpTipLine-StringsLiterally_files/stringLiterals3.jpg" border="1"></center>
<br>
As you can see, even though neither of our local variables, <font face="courier">one</font> or <font face="courier">two</font>,
refer to our String object, there is still a reference to it from the
String Literal Pool. Therefore, the object is not elgible for garbage
collection. The object is always reachable through use of the intern()
method, as referred to earlier.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>Like I said at the outset of this article,
virtually none of this information is included on the SCJP exam.
However, I constantly see this question coming up in the SCJP forum and
on various mock exams. These are a few of the highlights you can keep
in mind when it comes to String literals:
<ul>
<li>Equivalent String Literals (even those stored in separate classes in separate packages) will refer to the same String object.</li>
<li>In general, String Literals are not eligible for garbage collection. Ever.</li>
<li>Strings created at run-time will always be distinct from those created from String Literals.</li>
<li>You can reuse String Literals with run-time Strings by utilizing the intern() method.</li>
<li>The best way to check for String equality is to use the equals() method.</li>
</ul>
