Day 1
1. Refer to today's sequence (day1-data\day1-help\sequence.txt) , to revise
1.1 Solve ready code samples , as discussed in the theory session
(Test Param Passing )
1.2 import day1.1 in your new workspace to revise inheritance n run time polymorphism.

2. Hands on 
Create a  class Point2D  , under package "com.cdac.geometry" for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

3.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

3.2 Add public String show()) --to return point's x & y co-ords

3.3 Add isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.

3.4 Add a method , calculateDistance , to calc distance between 2 points
Hint : use distance formula.

3.5  Create a driver  class(for UI)  , in the "tester" package "TestPoints" , with main(..)

Ask user , how many points to plot? :
Create suitable array.

3.6  Accept x,y co-ordinates for all the points n store it suitably.
3.7  Display x,y co-ordinates of all the points plotted so far ,using for-each loop.
3.8  Accept 2 indices from user .
Find out if the points at these indices are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. 
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.
