Do subclasses inherit private data members from it's superclass?

NO !
Explanation :

As per the java language specification : 

Members of a class that are declared private are not inherited by subclasses of that class. Only members of a class that are declared protected or public are inherited by subclasses declared in a package other than the one in which the class is declared.

BUT what we mean here by inheritance is , are private members accessible in a subclass ?
That answer is NO

BUT , sub class instance DOES CONTAIN private fields of their superclasses .
 
eg : Person has data members  : private firstName , lastName

Student extends Person 
It has ADDITIONAL data members :private   gradYear,course,fees,marks

Answer this !
Can you access firstName & lastName from Student class ? NO

Student IS-A Person

So when you create an instance of a Student : firstName n lastName will be present in Student object , mem allocated in heap.

So how many slots will you show in Student object ? 
CP + 6 slots .
