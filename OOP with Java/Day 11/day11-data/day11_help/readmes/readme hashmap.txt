How HashMap internally works in Java

 
Hash Map is one of the most used collection. It doesn't extend from  Collection i/f.
BUT collection view of a map can be obtained using keySet,values or entrySet() 

Internal Implementation

HashMap works on the principal of hashing.

What is hashing ?
Hashing means using some function or algorithm to map object data to some representative integer value.

Map.Entry interface ---static nested interface of Map i/f

This interface represents a map entry (key-value pair). 

HashMap in Java stores both key and value object ref , in bucket, as an object of Entry class which implements this nested interface Map.Entry.

hashCode() -HashMap provides put(key, value) for storing and get(key) method for retrieving Values from HashMap. 

When put() method is used to store (Key, Value) pair, HashMap implementation calls hashcode on Key object to calculate a hash that is used to find a bucket where Entry object will be stored. 

When get() method is used to retrieve value, again key object is used to calculate a hash which is used then to find a bucket where that particular key is stored.

equals() - equals() method is used to compare objects for equality. In case of HashMap key object is used for comparison, also using equals() method Map knows how to handle hashing collision (hashing collision means more than one key having the same hash value, thus assigned to the same bucket. In that case objects are stored in a linked list (growable --singly linked)

 Bucket term used here is actually an index of array, that array is called table in HashMap implementation. Thus table[0] is referred as bucket0, table[1] as bucket1 and so on.


HashMap uses equals() method to see if the key is equal to any of the already inserted keys (Recall that there may be more than one entry in the same bucket). Note that, with in a bucket key-value pair entries (Entry objects) are stored in a linked-list . In case hash is same, but equals() returns false (which essentially means more than one key having the same hash or hash collision) Entry objects are stored, with in the same bucket, in a linked-list.

In short ,  there are three scenarios in case of put() -

Using hashCode() method, hash value will be calculated. Using that hash it will be ascertained, in which bucket particular entry will be stored.
equals() method is used to find if such a key already exists in that bucket, if no then a new node is created with the map entry and stored within the same bucket. A linked-list is used to store those nodes.
If equals() method returns true, which means that the key already exists in the bucket. In that case, the new value will overwrite the old value for the matched key.
 

How get() methods works internally

As we already know how Entry objects are stored in a bucket and what happens in the case of Hash Collision it is easy to understand what happens when key object is passed in the get method of the HashMap to retrieve a value.

Using the key again hash value will be calculated to determine the bucket where that Entry object is stored, in case there are more than one Entry object with in the same bucket stored as a linked-list equals() method will be used to find out the correct key. As soon as the matching key is found get() method will return the value object stored in the Entry object.

In case of null Key

Since HashMap also allows null, though there can only be one null key in HashMap. While storing the Entry object HashMap implementation checks if the key is null, in case key is null, it always map to bucket 0 as hash is not calculated for null keys.
-----------------------------------------

HashMap changes in Java 8

Though HashMap implementation provides constant time performance O(1) for get() and put() method but that is in the ideal case when the Hash function distributes the objects evenly among the buckets.

But the performance may worsen in the case hashCode() used is not proper and there are lots of hash collisions. In case of hash collision entry objects are stored as a node in a linked-list and equals() method is used to compare keys. That comparison to find the correct key with in a linked-list is a linear operation so in a worst case scenario the complexity becomes O(n).

To address this issue in Java 8 hash elements use balanced trees instead of linked lists after a certain threshold is reached. Which means HashMap starts with storing Entry objects in linked list but after the number of items in a bucket becomes larger than a certain threshold, the bucket will change from using a linked list to a balanced tree, this will improve the worst case performance from O(n) to O(log n).

More details
Hash collision degrades the performance of HashMap significantly. With this new approach, existing applications can expect performance improvements in case they are using HashMaps having large number of elements by simply upgrading to Java 8.

Hash collisions have negative impact on the lookup time of HashMap. When multiple keys end up in the same bucket, then values along with their keys are placed in a linked list. In case of retrieval, linked list has to be traversed to get the entry. In worst case scenario, when all keys are mapped to the same bucket, the lookup time of HashMap increases from O(1) to O(n).

Java 8 has come with the following improvements/changes of HashMap objects in case of high collisions.

The alternative String hash function added in Java 7 has been removed.
Buckets containing a large number of colliding keys will store their entries in a balanced tree instead of a linked list after certain threshold is reached.
Above changes ensure performance of O(log(n)) in worst case scenarios (hash function is not distributing keys properly) and O(1) with proper hashCode().

How linked list is replaced with binary tree?

In Java 8, HashMap replaces linked list with a binary tree when the number of elements in a bucket reaches certain threshold. While converting the list to binary tree, hashcode is used as a branching variable. If there are two different hashcodes in the same bucket, one is considered bigger and goes to the right of the tree and other one to the left. But when both the hashcodes are equal, HashMap assumes that the keys are comparable, and compares the key to determine the direction so that some order can be maintained. It is a good practice to make the keys of HashMap comparable.

This JDK 8 change applies only to HashMap, LinkedHashMap and ConcurrentHashMap.
