Day 1
1. Refer to today's sequence (day1-data\day1-help\sequence.txt) , to revise
1.1 Solve ready code samples , as discussed in the theory session
(Test Param Passing )
1.2 import day1.1 in your new workspace to revise inheritance n run time polymorphism.

2. Hands on 
Create a  class Point2D  , under package "com.cdac.geometry" for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

3.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

3.2 Add public String show()) --to return point's x & y co-ords

3.3 Add isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.

3.4 Add a method , calculateDistance , to calc distance between 2 points
Hint : use distance formula.

3.5  Create a driver  class(for UI)  , in the "tester" package "TestPoints" , with main(..)

Ask user , how many points to plot? :
Create suitable array.

3.6  Accept x,y co-ordinates for all the points n store it suitably.
3.7  Display x,y co-ordinates of all the points plotted so far ,using for-each loop.
3.8  Accept 2 indices from user .
Find out if the points at these indices are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. 
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.


Day 2

0. Open java docs , index.html in your browser

1. Complete pending work
(MUST)

2. Revise today's work , by referring to sequence.txt n importing day2.1 project in your workspace

3. Answer this
When you call : System.out.println(ref);
 how does it automatically call ref.toString() ?

4. Look at the mem diagrams.

5. Hands on (OPTIONAL)

5.1 Can you arrange Fruit,Apple,Orange,Mango in inheritance hierarchy ?

Use tight encapsulation.

5.2 Properties (instance variables)  : color : String , weight : double , name:String, fresh : boolean

5.3 Add suitable constructor.

5.4 Override  toString correctly to return state of all fruits (return only  : name ,color , weight )

5.5 Add a taste() method to return String form of the taste of the Fruit
eg :  public String taste()

For Fruit : Can you identify taste of any general fruit ?
So  return :  "no specific taste" 

Apple : should return  "sweet n sour"
Mango : should return  "sweet"
Orange : should return  "sour"

5.6 Add specific functionality , in the sub classes
In Mango : public void pulp() {Display name n color of the fruit + a mesg  creating  pulp!}
In Orange : public void juice() {Display name n weight of the fruit + a mesg extracting juice!}
In Apple : public void jam() {Display name of the fruit + a mesg  making jam!}


5.7 Add all of above classes under the package "com.app.fruits"

5.8 Create java application FruitBasket , with main method , as a tester
5.9 Prompt user for the basket size n create suitable data structure

5.10 Supply options
1. Add Mango
2. Add Orange
3. Add Apple
NOTE : You will be adding a fresh fruit in the basket , in all of above options.

4. Display names of all fruits in the basket.

5. Display name,color,weight , taste of all fresh fruits , in the basket.


6. Mark a fruit in a basket , as stale(=not fresh)
i/p : index 
o/p : error message (in case of invalid index) or mark it stale

7. Mark all sour fruits stale 
Hint : Use equals() method of the String class.

8. Invoke fruit specific functionality (pulp / juice / jam)
i/p : index
Invoke correct functionality (pulp / juice / jam)

10. Exit 


Day 3

NO new assignments !!!

1. Complete Day1 n Day2's assignment
(MUST)

2. Revise 
2.1 Refer to today's sequence
2.2 import day3.1 project in your workspace , to see the need of abstraction
(Here we had to add un necessarily , instanceof checking n downcasting)

2.3 import day3.2  , to see the need of abstraction
(Here we DID NOT ADD  , instanceof checking n downcasting , BUT had to add dummy implementation of area n perimeter)

2.4 import day3.3 , to revise abstract methods n class

2.5 import  day3.4 , to revise interfaces.


Day 4

1. import day4.1 to revise exception handling.
Use sequence.txt n readme for complete understanding

2. import day4.2 to revise custom exceptions

2.5 Complete pending work.

3. Solve this.
Fresh business scenario to apply inheritance , polymorphism n abstraction to emp based organization scenario.

Create Emp based organization structure --- Emp , Mgr , Worker
All of above classes must be in --com.app.org

3.1 Emp state--- id(int), firstName, lastName , deptId , basic(double)
emp id MUST be automatically generated.

Behaviour ---1.  get emp details -- using  toString.

2. compute net salary 

3.2 Mgr state  ---id,name,basic,deptId , perfBonus
Behaviour ----1. get mgr details :  using toString. 
2. compute net salary (formula: basic+perfBonus) -- override computeNetSalary
3. get performance bonus. --add a new method to return bonus.(getter)


3.3 Worker state  --id,name,basic,deptId,hoursWorked,hourlyRate
Behaviour--- 
1. get worker details -- :  override toString.
2.  compute net salary (formula:  = basic+(hoursWorked*hourlyRate) --override computeNetSalary
3. get hrlyRate of the worker  -- add a new method to return hourly rate of a worker.(getter)

Organize classes in inheritance  hierarchy.

NOTE : toString method SHOULD NOT include the net salary of the employee

Write TestOrganization in "tester" package.
Create suitable array to store organization details.
Provide following options

1. Hire Manager
i/p : manager details , except id

2. Hire Worker  
i/p : worker details , except id

3. Display information of all employees(toString) including net salary(computeNetSalary)  using single for-each loop.

4. Update basic salary
i/p : emp id , salary increment
In case of invalid emp id  , either : display error message directly 
OR (still better)
throw custom exception n handle it in centralized manner 
(This can be added later!)

10 Exit


Day 5.

0. Refer to java docs n go through import String class API
Object class's equals method

1. import day5.1 to revise string API n string builder API

2. import day5.2 to revise , basic part of Showroom management system :
Vehicle class

3. IMPORTANT : MUST go through , overriding of equals method , in Vehicle class

4. Complete earlier work

5. New work : 
Ensure Unique criteria for emps : firstName n lastName
Meaning : You should not accept dup emp details , if their firstName n lastName is same
How will you ensure this ?
