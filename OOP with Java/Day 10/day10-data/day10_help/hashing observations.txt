For BEST understanding of hashing algo
1. In Emp class : neither equals nor hashCode was overridden => dups were not detected!

2. In Emp class : overrode only equals
NO chnage : => dups were not detected!

Reason behind not detecting the dups : Mandatory part of the contract bet overriding of equals n hasCode was NOT followed
Contract : EQUAL objects MUST produce SAME hash code.

3. In Emp class : overrode equals n hashCode as per mandatory part of the contract
EQUAL objects MUST produce SAME hash code.
hashCode : 100
obs : detecting the dups BUT time complexity : O(n)

4. In emp class : override both : hashCode n equals , to follow mandatory as well as optional poart of the contract
EQUAL objects MUST produce SAME hash code AND Un equal objects SHOULD produce distinct hash codes to ensure O(1)
