Regarding functional programming


What is functional programming ?

Functional programming is the way of writing s/w applications that uses only pure fuctions & immutable values.

Main concepts of FP are
1. Pure functions & side effects
2. Referential transperency
3. First class functions & higher order funcs.
4. Anonymous functions
5. Immutability
6. Recursion & tail recursion
7. Statements
8. Strict & Lazy evaluations
9. Pattern Matching
10 Closures

Why Functional Programming paradigm
Elegance and simplicity
Easier decomposition of problems
Code more closely tied to the problem domain

Through these , one can achieve : 

Straightforward unit testing
Easier debugging
Simple concurrency
