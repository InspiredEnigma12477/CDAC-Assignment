Binary Number System
--A binary number system is one of the four types of number system.  0 1
In computer applications, where binary numbers are represented by only 
two symbols or digits, i.e. 0 (zero) and 1(one). 
The binary numbers here are expressed in the base-2 numeral system. (
For example, (101)base2 is a binary number. 
Each digit in this system is said to be a bit.
bit:-smallest unit of information
byte:-8bit = 1 byte
1024bytes=1kilobyte
1024kb=1megabyte
1024mb=1gigabyte

What is a Binary Number System?
Binary Number System: According to digital electronics and mathematics, 
a binary number is defined as a number that is expressed in 
the binary system or base 2 numeral system. 
It describes numeric values by two separate symbols; 
1 (one) and 0 (zero). The base-2 system is the positional 
notation with 2 as a radix.

The binary system is applied internally by almost 
all latest computers and computer-based devices because of its 
direct implementation in electronic circuits using logic gates. 
Every digit is referred to as a bit.

How to Calculate Binary Numbers
For example, the number to be operated is 1235.

Thousands	Hundreds	Tens	Ones
1	          2	         3	5
This indicates,

1235 = 1 × 1000 + 2 × 100 + 3 × 10 + 5 × 1

Given,

1000	= (10)^3 = 10 × 10 × 10
100	= (10)^2= 10 × 10
10	= (10)^1 = 10
1	= (10)^0 (any value to the exponent zero is one) 
The above table can be described as,

Thousands|	|Hundreds|	|Tens|	  |Ones|
(10)^3	           (10)^2      (10)^1	 (10)^0
1	           2	          3	  5

1235 = 1 × 1000 + 2 × 100 + 3 × 10 + 5 × 1

= 1 × (10)^3 + 2 × (10)^2 + 3 × (10)^1 + 5 × (10)^0
