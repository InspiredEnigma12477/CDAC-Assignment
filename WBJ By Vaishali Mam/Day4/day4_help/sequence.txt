JSP Basics


Before that : Solve
eg : remote web server IP address is  --ip1 
In web app(/day6.1) --- /s1(is a servlet) ---
Creates a  cookie  --- name --"clnt_info" , value --"details1234"  & sends it to a clnt.

clnt IP adr--  ip2

Q Will Clnt browser of ip2  send the cookies in request header ?

1. clnt sends the URL --- http://ip3:8080/day6.1 : NO --since ip3 : different IP address
2. clnt sends the URL --- http://ip1:8080/day2/.... : NO --since day2 is a different web app
3. clnt sends the URL --- http://ip1:8080/day6.1/s2 : YES
4. clnt sends the URL --- http://ip1:8080/day6.1/s10 : YES



Default behaviour : cookies are by default sent to the SAME web app of origin
Can it be modified by Cookie class methods? YES
Which ones ?

setPath : allows the cookie/s to be shared across multiple web apps hosted on the same server.
setDomain : allows the cookie/s to be shared across multiple hosts from the same domain
