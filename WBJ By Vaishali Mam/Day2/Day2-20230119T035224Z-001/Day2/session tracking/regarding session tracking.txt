What is a Session?

Session is a conversional state between client and server and it can consists of multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information about the session  is passed between server and client in every request and response.

HTTP protocol and Web Servers are stateless, what it means is that for web server every request is a new request to process and they cant identify if its coming from client that has been sending request previously.

But sometimes in web applications, we should know who the client is and process the request accordingly. For example, a shopping cart application should know who is sending the request to add an item and in which cart the item has to be added or who is sending checkout request so that it can charge the amount to correct client.

What is the need of session tracking?

1. To identify the clnt among multiple clnts
2. To remember the conversational state of the clnt(eg : list of the purchased books/ shopping cart/bank acct details/stocks) throughout current session

session = Represents duration or time interval 
default session timeout for Tomcat =30minutes

Session Consists of all requests/resps coming from/ sent to SAME clnt from login to logout or till session expiration tmout.

There are several techniques for session tracking.
J2EE specific techniques : 
1. Plain Cookie based scenario
2. HttpSession interface 
3. HttpSession + URL rewriting
----------------------------------------------
Techniques

1. Plain Cookie based scenario

What is a cookie?
Cookie is small amount of text data.
Created by -- server (servlet or JSP prog or WC) & downloaded (sent) to clnt browser---within response header
 Cookie represents data shared across multiple dyn pages from the SAME web appln.(meant for the same client)

Steps :

1. Create cookie/s instance/s
javax.servlet.http.Cookie(String cName,String cVal)

2.Add the cookie/s to the resp hdr.
HttpServletResponse API :
void addCookie(Cookie c)

3. To retrieve the cookies :
HttpServletRequest :
Cookie[] getCookies()

4.Cookie class methods : 
String getName()
String getValue()
void setMaxAge(int ageInSeconds)
def age =-1 ---> browser stores cookie in cache
=0 ---> clnt browser should delete cookie
>0 --- persistent cookie --to be stored on clnt's hard disk.

int getMaxAge()

Disadvantages of pure cookie based scenario
0. Web developer (servlet prog) has to manage cookies.
1. Cookies can handle only text data : storing Java obj or bin data difficult.
2. As no of cookies inc., it will result into increased net traffic.
3. In cookie based approach : entire state of the clnt is saved on the clnt side. If the clnt browser rejects the cookies: state will be lost : session tracking fails.


How to redirect client automatically to next page ? (in the NEXT request)
API of HttpServletResponse
public void sendRedirect(String redirectLoc)
eg : resp.sendRedirect("s2");

IMPORTANT : 
WC -- throws 
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot call sendRedirect() after the response has been committed(eg : pw.flush(),pw.close()...)
	


Technique # 2 : Session tracking based on HttpSession API
In this technique : 
Entire state of the client is not saved on client side , instead saved on the server side data structure (Http Sesion object) BUT the key to this Http Session object is STILL sent to client in form of a cookie.(cookie management is done by WC)


Servlet programmer  can store/restore java objects directly under the session scope(API : setAttribute/getAttribute)


Above mentioned , disadvantages ---0, 1 & 2 are reomved.
BUT entire session tracking again fails , if cookies are disabled.

Steps for javax.servlet.http.HttpSession i/f based session tracking.

1. Get Http Session object from WC

API of HttpServletRequest ---
HttpSession getSession()
Meaning --- Servlet requests WC to either create n return a NEW HttpSession object(for new clnt) or ret the existing one from WC's heap for existing client.


HttpSession --- i/f from javax.servlet.http
In case of new client : 
 HttpSession<String,Object> --empty map
String,Object ---- (entry)= attribute

OR
HttpSession getSession(boolean create)

2. : How to save data in HttpSession?(scope=entire session)
API of HttpSession i/f
public void setAttribute(String attrName,Object attrVal)
eg : hs.setAttribute("clnt_info",validatedCustomer);//no javac err
 attribute : server side object ---server side entry (key n value pair) --map


equivalent to map.put(k,v)
eg : hs.setAttribute("cart",l1);



3. For retrieving session data(getting attributes)
public Object getAttribute(String attrName) //key
eg : Customer cust=(Customer) hs.getAttribute("clnt_info");

4. To get session ID (value of the cookie whose name is jsessionid  -- unique per client by WC)
String getId()

4.5 How to remove attribute from the session scope?
public void removeAttribute(String attrName)
eg : hs.removeAttribute("clnt_info");

5. How to invalidate session?
HttpSession API
public void invalidate()
(WC marks HS object on the server side for GC ---BUT cookie  is NOT deleted from clnt browser)

6. HttpSession API
public boolean isNew()
Rets true for new client & false for existing client.

7.How to find all attr names from the session ?
public Enumeration<String> getAttributeNames()
--rets java.util.Enumeration of attr names.

8. Default session timeout value for Tomcat = 30 mins
How to change session tmout ?
HttpSession  i/f method
public void setMaxInactiveInterval(int secs)
eg : hs.setMaxInactiveInterval(300); --for 5 mins .

OR via xml tags in web.xml
<session-config>
  <session-timeout>5</session-timeout> : unit : min
</session-config>


NOTE : 
What is an attribute ?
attribute = server side object(entry/mapping=key value pair)
who creates server side attrs ? -- web developer (servlet or JSP prog)
Each attribute has --- attr name(String) & attr value (java.lang.Object)
Attributes can exist in one of 3 scopes --- req. scope,session scope or application scope
1. Meaning of req scoped attr = attribute is visible for current req.
2. Meaning of session scoped attr = attribute is visible for current session.(shared across multiple reqs coming from SAME clnt)
3. Meaning of application scoped attr = attribute is visible for current web appln.(shared across multiple reqs from ANY clnt BUT for the SAME web application)
