Q. There is a parking slot management problem
There are 7 parking slots
Empty parking slot is denoted by 0 and full is denoted by car no
Also there is queue of size 5 outside the parking slot

If car comes in, 
	if any parking slot is empty (0) then put the car in that slot
	If all parking are full, put the car in queue (if queue is not full)
	if queue is also full --> Give message parking full

If car goes out  
check if there is any car in queue and put one car in same parking slot as going out car
if no car in queue then mark the slot of this car as 0

Display parking status and queue for every car coming in or going out.

Sample input:
i means car goes in , o means car goes out

i/p1 -> i20,i30,i50,o30,i78,i34,i90,i234,i345,i123,o20,o78,i987,i231,o234,i456
i/p2 -> i20,i30,i50,i78,i34,i90,i234,i345,i123,o20,o78,i987,i231,i456
